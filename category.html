      <p class="card-text">Pet rodents behave just like their wild cousins, which means they can be challenging to look after. Owning and caring for a pet rodent is great fun and very rewarding, but it's also a big responsibility and commitment in terms of care and finances. From mice and rats to gerbils and chinchillas, rodents have very different needs, so it's important to research what your particular small furries need. </p>

      <h4 class="card-title">Fishes</h4>
      <p class="card-text">From barbs to bettas and clownfish to cichlids, fish make wonderful pets for those who love the vibrancy, beauty and peacefulness of a home aquarium or pond. Whether you’re an experienced fish keeper or are planning to introduce a fish tank into your home, you’re sure to know just how beautiful pet fish can be!
  
  Like with any pet, the most important part of keeping fish is making sure that your underwater friends are happy, healthy and comfortable in their environments. After all, your fish rely on you to give them tasty meals, the perfect place to swim and medicine when they’re not well! But as experienced fish keepers will know, giving your fish the right environment isn’t always as straightforward as it might seem. In fact, depending on the type of fish you choose, your fish might need quite a specialist tank set-up, equipment and more complex care. </p>
